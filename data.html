      <h1>DATA AND METHODOLOGY</h1>
    </br>
      <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 25px">National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 25px">The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is an incident-based
         reporting system used by law enforcement agencies in the United States
         for the collection and reporting of data on criminal offenses. This dataset
        provides incredibly detailed information about the victims and offenders (including
        race, ethnicity, age, sex), weapon, circumstances, and most importantly the
        relationship between the victim and the offender. Due to the lack of data
        exclusively about intimate partner violence at the national level, we
        relied on a subset of NIBRS data for our analysis. A limitation of the NIBRS data
        is that incidents are reported on a voluntary basis by law enforcement offices across
        the country which leads to significant gaps in the availability of the data. States
        such as New York, Florida, and California do not report incidents to NIBRS at all
        and some states started doing sp only in 2019.

      <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 25px">Methodology</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 25px">This project relied on a multitude
        of technologies including Python, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, the ArcGIS JavaScript API,
        and HTML. Below you can find a general outline of the three main steps we used to conduct
        our analysis and produce this web application.

            <h2 style="color: #000000">Python</h2>
            <p>We built a Python script that allowed us to extract all incidents between
            2006 and 2019 where the victim and the offender were or had been intimate partners.
            We subset the data to focus exclusively on simple assault, aggravated assault, and
            homicide and nonnegligent manslaughter. In order to be able to map the incidents at
            the county level, we used the county and state information provided and assigned each
            entry their corresponding FIPS code. We then exported the subset into csv
            files corresponding to each year between 2006 and 2019.</p>

          <div class="row-method">
            <h2 style="color: #000000">ArcGIS</h2>
            <p>This project relied heavily on ESRI products, particularly ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online,
            and the ArcGIS JavaScript API. Once we were done with the data processing in Python, we
            imported the data into ArcGIS Pro and used the FIPS codes to join it to a shpaefile of
            all US counties. We exported the joined layers as Web Layers onto ArcGIS Online. We then
            incorporated all layers into our web application using the ArcGIS JavaScript API which
            also allowed us to incorporate a series of widgets into our map.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row-method">
            <h2 style="color: #000000">HTML</h2>
            <p>We built this web application using the html and css styling skills we learned throughout the semester. We aimed
               for a minimalist style that clearly communicated our message. We relied on the
            ArcGIS JavaScript API for all map related functionality as well as some local
            JavaScript for the website's functionality. The integration between our html files
            and the ArcGIS JavaScript API were notably successful and allowed us to provide a
            better user experience.</p>
