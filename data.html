      <h1>DATA AND METHODOLOGY</h1>
    </br>
      <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 25px">National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 25px">The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is an incident-based
         reporting system used by law enforcement agencies in the United States
         for the collection and reporting of data on criminal offenses. This dataset
        provides incredibly detailed information about the victims and offenders (including
        race, ethnicity, age, sex), weapon, circumstances, and most importantly the
        relationship between the victim and the offender. Due to the lack of data
        exclusively about intimate partner violence at the national level, we
        relied on a subset of NIBRS data for our analysis. A limitation of the NIBRS data
        is that incidents are reported on a voluntary basis by law enforcement offices across
        the country which leads to significant gaps in the availability of the data. States
        such as New York, Florida, and California do not report incidents to NIBRS at all
        and some states started doing sp only in 2019.

      <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 25px">Methodology</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 25px">This project relied on a multitude
        of technologies including Python, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, the ArcGIS JavaScript API,
        and HTML. Below you can find a general outline of the three main steps we used to conduct
        our analysis and produce this web application.

          <div class="row-method">
            <h2 style="color: #000000">Python</h2>
            <p>We built a Python script that allowed us to extract all incidents between
            2006 and 2019 where the victim and the offender were or had been intimate partners.
            This corresponded to three relationship IDs: (3) boyfriend/girlfriend, (21) spouse,
            and (26) ex-spouse. We then subset the data even further to focus exclusively on
            incidents of three offense IDs: (51) simple assault, (27) aggravated assault, and
            (32) homicide and nonnegligent manslaughter. In order to map the incidents we
            used FIPS codes as geographic references to map the incidents at the county level.
            This was the smallest possible unit of analysis using NIBRS data. We then exported the subset into csv
            files corresponding to each year between 2006 and 2019.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #000000">ArcGIS</h2>
            <p>This project relied heavily on ESRI products, particularly ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online,
            and the ArcGIS JavaScript API. Once we were done with the data processing in Python, we
            imported the data into ArcGIS Pro and used the FIPS codes to join it to a shpaefile of
            all US counties. We exported the joined layers as Web Layers onto ArcGIS Online. We then
            incorporated all layers into our web application using the ArcGIS JavaScript API which
            also allowed us to incorporate a series of widgets into our web map.</p>

          <div class="row-method">
            <h2 style="color: #000000">HTML</h2>
            <p>We built this web application using html and css styling. We aimed
               for a minimalist style that clearly communicated our message. We relied on the
            ArcGIS JavaScript API for all map related functionality as well as some local
            JavaScript for the website's functionality.</p>
