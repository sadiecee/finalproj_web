      <h1>Intimate Partner Violence in the US</h1>
      <p id="wordswords"> The CDC defines Intimate Partner Violence as physical
        violence, sexual violence, stalking, and psychological aggression by a current
        or former intimate partner (CDC 2021). According to NCADV (2021), on average, nearly
        20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the
        United States. In a single year, this equates to more than 10 million men and women.
        Despite the staggering numbers, there is little to no publicly available resources
        showing what the spatial distribution of this phenomena looks like. In an attempt to
        help close that gap, this project maps intimate partner violence in the United States
        at the county level between 2006 and 2019. The map below allows you to visualize the
        spatial distribution of all incidents that took place between intimate partners on a
        yearly basis. With the button on the top right corner of the map, you can choose to
        display incidents of Simple Assault, Aggravated Assault, and Homicide and
        Nonnegligent Manslaugther from 2006 to 2019.<p>

          </br>
            <h2>What does the spatial distribution of intimate partner violence in the United States look like?</h2>
            <p>Looking at the spatial distribution of the total counts of incidents
              of intimate partner violence, it is clear to see a cluster of incidents
            going from North to South across the middle of the country for counties from
            Michigan to West Virginia. The same is true when looking at incidents of
            simple assault. There is notably almost no distinction between conservative and progressive
            states. When looking at the aggravated assault layers, there seem to be higher incident counts in large urban areas such as
            Seattle, WA, Dallas, TX, and Boston, MA versus more rural counties. This is also true when it comes to
            homicide and nonegligent manslaugther which has a clear prevalence in cities.
            It is important to recognize that the lack of reporting from states with large populations
            such as Florida and California significantly affect what we understand as the ranges of the data.
            Future research could benefit from the availability of a more complete dataset.</p>
          </br>
          <p>*This analysis does not include NIBRS data for 2020 which was made available to the public as this project was being completed.</p>
